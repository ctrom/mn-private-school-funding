SAINT PAUL, Minn. (KTTC) – How does the Gopher State determine the money given out to its nearly 330 public school districts? KTTC was hopeful Minnesota’s Commissioner of Education would help us simplify this complex issue; however, the Department of Education denied our interview request.

KTTC first made contact with the department last November, following the rejection of a several school referenda ballot measures tied to the general election.

Earlier this month, MDE provided KTTC with this response, “Thank you for your patience. Commissioner Jett is not available for an interview, but the Minnesota House of Representatives has a document they created that offers some good information on school funding, which I’ve attached.”

There was no additional explanation as to why the commissioner wasn’t available to talk with KTTC on-camera.

As for that attached report, referenced in the interview denial, it’s called [Minnesota School Finance: A Guide for Legislators](https://www.house.mn.gov/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf). The descriptor says the guidebook explains how public elementary and secondary schools are funded in Minnesota. It was put together by a legislative analyst in November 2024. The publication is 157 pages.

In a high-level review, for fiscal year 2025, the report states each Minnesota school district’s general education revenue is a sum total of 14 components, two of which are the same for all districts when it comes to per pupil unit spending. The other 12 components vary by a district’s demographic and geographic characteristics. General education revenue has existed in its current form since the 1988-1989 school year. The legislative report says the program has remained “relatively stable” over the last 35 years.

Pertaining to per pupil unit spending, the state’s formula allowance for 2025 is $7,281. That’s an increase of around $140 over the 2024 allowance, or a 2% adjustment.

In addition to general education revenue, Minnesota school districts also receive state appropriations through so-called categorical aids and authorized property tax levies, which provide funds for specific purposes.

For the 2023-2024 school year, the state provided approximately 66.4% of the total costs of public education.
